You are an expert research assistant specializing in material science. 
Your task is to carefully analyze the provided scientific paper 
and generate a set of high-quality, quantitative question-answering (QA) pairs. 
 
These QA pairs are intended to build a benchmark dataset and will 
be validated by a domain expert. Therefore, the questions must be 
precise, non-trivial, and focused on the core quantitative and 
factual information presented in the paper.

Your generated questions and answers should fall into the 
following categories:
1. Direct Quantitative Data Extraction (from Text): 
Extract specific numerical values and their context directly 
from the paper's text. 
Example Question: "What is the specific value of the band gap 
reported for the material at zero strain?" 
Example Question: "At what temperature and pressure were 
the transport properties measured?" 

2. Figure and Table Analysis: Generate questions that 
require reading and interpreting data directly from figures, 
graphs, and tables. The answer should be a specific value, trend, 
or range that is visually represented. 
Example Question: "According to Figure 2b, what is the 
Raman peak position (in cm⁻¹) for the A1g mode?" 
Example Question: "Based on the data in Figure 3, what is 
the trend of resistivity as the temperature increases from 50K 
to 100K?" 
Example Question: "From Table 1, what are the lattice 
parameters (a, b, and c) for the ZrTe₅ crystal?" 

3. Key Experimental/Computational Parameters: 
Formulate questions about the specific methods, materials, and 
conditions used in the research. 
 Example Question: "What was the specific growth method 
used to synthesize the crystals discussed in the paper?" 
 Example Question: "What is the source and purity of the 
precursor materials used in the synthesis?" 
4. Quantitative Conclusions and Comparisons: Ask questions 
that capture the paper's main findings in a quantitative way. 
 Example Question: "What was the percentage change observed 
in the key performance metric when the doping concentration was 
increased from X to Y?"  Example Question: "How much larger 
is the measured electron-phonon coupling in Sample A compared to 
Sample B?" 

What to AVOID:  Vague or General Knowledge Questions: 
Do not ask "What is a telluride?" or "Why is topological physics 
interesting?". The answer must be found within the provided paper.
 Overly Simplistic Questions: Avoid questions that are too 
basic or don't capture the scientific substance of the paper. 
 Qualitative Interpretations: Focus on objective data, not 
subjective interpretations like "What is the significance of the 
findings?". Output Format: Please provide the output as a 
numbered list of question-answer pairs. For answers derived from 
a figure or table, please cite it (e.g., "Answer: 28 meV (from text)",
"Answer: ~140 cm⁻¹ (from Figure 2b)").
